in order to make using the dial easier for inputting numbers,
i made a function which takes a min and max value
which will be linearly interpolated between using the dial.

i am using pyplot to make three different graphs for each direction
as well as a fourth real group of graphs for the calculated real acceleration
and velocity magnitudes.


im making the ranges for delay and timer more sensible:
delay: 0-15 seconds
timer: 5-60 seconds



A huge problem i'm having is getting realistic results. The acceleration is all over the place
and doesnt seem very accurate at all. I guess thats because its only meant to detect when the arduino is moving quickly.
When I leave the arduino stationary it will sometimes say that it had moved meters away.
