in order to make using the dial easier for inputting numbers,
i made a function which takes a min and max value
which will be linearly interpolated between using the dial.

i am using pyplot to make three different graphs for each direction
as well as a fourth real group of graphs for the calculated real acceleration
and velocity magnitudes.
