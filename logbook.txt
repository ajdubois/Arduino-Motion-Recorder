in order to make using the dial easier for inputting numbers,
i made a function which takes a min and max value
which will be linearly interpolated between using the dial.

i am using pyplot to make three different graphs for each direction
as well as a fourth real group of graphs for the calculated real acceleration
and velocity magnitudes.


im making the ranges for delay and timer more sensible:
delay: 0-15 seconds
timer: 5-60 seconds



A huge problem i'm having is getting realistic results. The acceleration is all over the place
and doesnt seem very accurate at all. I guess thats because its only meant to detect when the arduino is moving quickly.
When I leave the arduino stationary it will sometimes say that it had moved meters away.

After looking it up, the lowest possible range of the accelerometer is +/-2g, which explains this behaviour.
With this level of sensitivity the graph this program will make can only be useful if the motion you are
observing involves accelerations greater than 2g, the arduino cant really tell whether its at rest or moving slightly.
